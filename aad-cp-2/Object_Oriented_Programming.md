<h1><p align="center">Object Oriented Programming</p></h1>
<br/>
Most of you might have heard this term Object Oriented Programming while trying to learn a programming language. So, what exactly is this thing? Is it of any importance? Do we even need Object Oriented programming? Lets take a look into this.

<h3>Various Programming Paradigms</h3>
<hr/>
Paradigm basically refers to a way of doing things. A programming paradigm defines the methodology of designing and implementing programs using the key features and other building blocks (such as key-words, etc.) of a programming language. So, a programming paradigm would give you an idea about the logic of a program i.e. how problems are generally analysed and solved in a particular programming language.

So, why did I talk about programming paradigms because this is where the concept and idea of Object Oriented programming begins. Object Oriented Programming (commonly known as OOP) or Procedural Oriented Programming(commonly known as POP) as nothing but different paradigms. So, lets take a look into what these two things namely OOP and POP actually mean.
